# Eric's Hornet Cockpit file repository

A bunch of files I've created as part of designing and building a home cockpit for the F/A-18C.  Used in DCS playing in VR.

Folders here are:
* **Arduino Code**: The code I have written to drive the Arduino boards I use in my build.  Also provides info on which boards
will work and what libraries are needed.
* **DCS lua Code**: Holds customizations to the "default.lua" file that defines how cockpit controls work.  With some
modifications to the .lua code it is possible to make toggle switches send an action when turned OFF in addition to
when turned ON.  Provides locations for the files and guidance on how to incorporate into DCS.
* **DXF files**: This has the CAD drawings that I used for the design of the side consoles and front panel, as well as
drawings used to construct the enclosures.
* **Pictures**: Images of the project at various stages in it's lifecycle.
* **STL files**: For various cockpit knobs and switches to mirror the actual Hornet and make it easier to quickly find
the right control in VR.
