# Eric's Hornet Cockpit file repository

A bunch of files I've created as part of designing and building a home cockpit for the F/A-18C.  Used in DCS playing in VR.

Folders here are:
* **Arduino Code**: Currently a placeholder, but will hold the files used for the Arduino boards used in the build.
* **DCS lua Code**: Currently a placeholder, but will uplaod the file I add to "defualt.lua" for the Hornet to allow
* **DXF files**: This has the CAD drawings that I used for the design of the side consoles and front panel, as well as
drawings used to construct the enclosures.
* **Pictures**: Images of the project at various stages in it's lifecycle.
on/off toggles to execute two different actions (e.g. gear up when switched on, down when switched off).
* **STL files**: For various cockpit knobs and switches to mirror the actual Hornet and make it easier to quickly find
the right control in VR.
