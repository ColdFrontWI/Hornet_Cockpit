# Arduino code

As of now this is a placeholder.  Two Arduinos in the pit as of Aug'20...one controls the AMPCD and countermeasures panel,
and the other manages the supplemental switches at the bottom right of the front panel.

I do plan to add two more which will require rewiring the right and left consoles.  Primary reason is a need a few more
inputs for some changes I want to implement.
