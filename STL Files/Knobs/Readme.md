# Knobs

Like the switches, it's helpful to be have shaped knobs to find the right control when in VR.  I found this to be particularly
true in two places:
* Interior lights panel
* HUD panel

All of the knobs here are used on potentiometers, rotary encorders, or rotary switches in my cockpit.  Most of them fit splined
6mm shafts except for the one marked D-shaft--that one will need you to add a heat set insert and set screw.

Once again, credit to [lynx.dk](http://lynx.dk/product-category/products/flight-simulator-gear/f-a-18c-hornet/knobs/) for some
helpful information.  I didn't use info from their site directly, but it pointed me to [EHC Knobs](http://www.ehcknobs.com/) and
and particularly the [Transilluminated series](http://www.ehcknobs.com/pdfs/catalog/transilluminated/Transilluminated_Full_Catalog.pdf).
Most of the knobs here are based on what I found in that catalog:
* Flat sides (exterior and interior light panels)
* Large pointy (INS and radar, splined and d-shaft versions)
* Triple and Quad (interior light panel)
* Double pointy small (couple of the HUD knobs and the VOX knob on the volume panel)

A couple are designed based on the foldout in the NATOPS manual:
* Parking brake handle
* Radio tune knobs

I still do plan to make a Rudder/TO trim knob, and knobs for the bleed air and cabin/suit temp.  I may also get to some of the
smaller, more nondescript knobs as well.

One other part that I will be including at some point is [blue73's AWESOME Jettison control
knob](https://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=239718) that he posted on the ED forums.
