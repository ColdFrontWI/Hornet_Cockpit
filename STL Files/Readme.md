* [**Knobs**](Knobs): Designed to be used on rotational controllers (potentiometers, rotary encoders, rotary switches).  All fit 6mm splined shafts unless otherwise noted.
* [**Switches**](Switches): Designed to be glued over "standard" bat-style toggle switches.  All have 6mm openings to accomodate the switch.
