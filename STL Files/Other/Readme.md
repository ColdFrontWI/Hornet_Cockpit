# Other

Random other STL files that I've found or created along the way.  A couple that are here:

* [**Button adapter.stl**](Button%20adapter.stl) and [**Multiselector gear 18t.stl**](Multiselector%20gear%2018t.stl)
are modifications to [blue73's awesome Jettison Select Knob](https://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=239718)
that allow me to use parts I had on hand including the pushbutton and rotary.  I [posted these to the ED
forums](https://forums.eagle.ru/showpost.php?p=4471487&postcount=58).
* [**Panel - lower LG.stl**](Panel%20-%20lower%20LG.stl) is something I created as a quick test to see if I
could 3D print overlays for my panel to give it a bit more depth.
