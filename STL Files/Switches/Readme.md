# 3D printed switch caps

Playing in VR, I have found that it's much easier to identify the correct switch when they are shaped
like the swtiches that you look look at.  All of the STLs in this folder are designed with 6mm openings
that can be glued on top of a "standard" "bat-shaped" toggle.  I used hot glue for a couple of them, but
found it messy so switched to good old Krazy Glue.

In addition to just standard "bat" shaped toggles, there are a few common switch shapes in the hornet
cockpit:
* Dome top (e.g. the refueling probe)
* Pointytop (e.g. Master Arm)
* Flat top (e.g. lighting mode)
I found some good pictures at [lynx.dk](http://lynx.dk/product-category/products/flight-simulator-gear/f-a-18c-hornet/f-a-18c-switch-tops/)
of what these are supposed to look like.

There are also a couple of "special" switches that I drew gauging the sizes based on the NATOPS panel foldout:
* Landing / taxi lights
* Launch bar

A couple are here because I used toggle switches in my build even though
they are not toggles in the actual hornet:
* Landing gear (I based this loosely on an [object from ThingiVerse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4405485), but made mine quite a bit smaller.)
* Arresting hook (Thanks to Larry Pucci on the F18 DIY Home Cockput Facebook group who sent me pictures with dimensions as a starting point.) 

Last thing is the switch guard for the fuel probe.  As DCS pilots know refueling can be a sensitive time, and
the easier it is to find the control the better!
