# Warthog / Virpil stick extensions

I had a 75mm extension that I was using with my Virpil WarBRD base and Thrustmaster Hornet grip, but I found that
my setup really needed a 50mm.  I wasn't too keen on spending ~$50 (with shipping) and waiting who knows how long
to get one from Virpil or another of the small supply shops, so I decided to design and print my own.  This was
well received, and at least one person requested a different length so I made several of lengths between 25
and 100mm.

Note there are three versions of each.  I found that the 36mm female thread on these designs was VERY tight
and difficult to install on my setup, so I created versions where the female threads are 36.5 and 37.0mm.
I think the issue with the 36 for me may be my printer being slightly out of square, but the 36.5 and 37.0
fit nicely.  You may need a bit of experimentation to find out which works best with your printer and
equipment.
