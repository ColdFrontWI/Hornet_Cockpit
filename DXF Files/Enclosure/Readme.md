# Enclosures

This shows how the left, right, and front consoles were built.  There are files that show the shapes that need to be
cut for each of the three encosures, as well as the acrylic pieces.  I built the enclosures out of a mix of 1/4"
and 1/2" MDF that I picked up at Home Depot.  The panel faces are [1/8" white acrylic I picked up from
Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XNXHZZH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

Note that the front console was actually built in two steps...I first built the rectangular box that did
not include the AMPCD (the "MDF - Front Panel...") files.  I had to modify it later when I added the AMPCD
("Acrylic-MDF - AMPCD replacement...")
