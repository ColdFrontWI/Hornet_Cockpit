The core of this home pit dates back well before the Hornet.  It started out as a flexible/modular system on which I
could easily swap controls between a yoke/civilian throttle quadrant and my t Flight HOTAS at the time.

When I got back into flight sims after a multiple-decade hiatus I expected to play mostly XPlane/MSFX (thus the yoke), but then I found
WarThunder, and racked up several hundred hours and got pretty good.  And then I found DCS and the time sink/spending
really increased.  I got a TM Warthog and built a simple switch box for the A-10C module that had some of the key controls
including all the arming switches, gear, etc.  That's about where this was back in Feb before I got started on the
Hornet pit.

Since I've been asked a couple of times, the seat here is basically a [kart racing seat that I found on
Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007VRCTD6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and mounted on
a DIY base.
