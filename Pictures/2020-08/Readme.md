# An AMPCD and some fancy knobs

As of August 2020, I have added the AMPCD and have upgraded from a TM Warthog base to a Virpil WarBRD.  In
addition, I picked up a 3D printer ([Creality Ender 3 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K3SZBHJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)),
and have been designing and printing various knobs and switches to make it much easier to find the right
control when flying in VR.
